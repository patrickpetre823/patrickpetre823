## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Patrick Petre

I'm in the process of building my GitHub as my data engineering/analsyst portfolio!

I completed my master's degree in mechanical engineering at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. In my master's thesis, I investigated how RNNs, especially LSTMs and GRUs, can be used to find anomalies in vehicle data. This sparked my interest in data engineering/analysis/science!

Skills: Python / Dash / Tableau / SQL 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my Finance Dashboard
